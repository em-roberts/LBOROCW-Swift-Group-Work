# Group I - No "I" In Team : Computational Physics I, PHA904, 2022

## Overview

Our final product can be located in the [Group I Coursework](/GroupICoursework/GroupICoursework/) directory. We have separated and tidied up the github to have the 5 folders of different chapters of code to show our progress through the project. We also have an [image folder](/img/) in which we have put our results from different iterations of our code. We also have the [plot.p file](/plot.p) in which we entered gnuplot commands to make the gnuplot implementation easier and quicker. Our attempt at chapter 8 is documented in the [chapter 8 xcode project](/Chapter%208%20Code/2D%20FDTD%20-%20Selectable%20Field/2D%20Electromagnetism%20-%20Chapter%208.xcodeproj/), this shows our initiative and potential in a 2D field. 

## Usage

1. Open the GitHub desktop extension on Mac
2. Clone this repository 
3. Open the repository in finder 
4. Copy the plot.p file in to the home directory of the mac
4. Open the Group I Coursework directory in xcode 
5. Press run, enter your input for the prompts given. 
6. Open the output in gnuplot along with loading plot.p

## Results

Here are a range of results from our outputs of different boundary values and different points per wavelength. The title of the images are as follows:
- I - to indicate it is a group I coursework result 
- First Number - indicates the location of the scattered field boundary in the grid. 
- Second Number - indicates the points per wavelength used.
